# RL-Mega-Man-v2
Reinforcement Learning in Mega Man, Version 2

The goal of this project is to make a framework that can perform reinforcement learning using the NEAT algorithm on the game Mega Man 2 for the NES. The game is emulated using the [FCEUX](http://fceux.com/web/home.html) emulator, and the reinforcement learning is accomplished via [LUA](https://www.lua.org/home.html) scripting.

Version 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/GideonMarsh/RL-Mega-Man).
